I am a Research Associate in Machine Learning at King's College London, working in
the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences. My current work,
in the [MMAG](http://kclmmag.org/) (Motion Modelling and Analysis Group) looks at
how manifold learning, and manifold alignment, together with tools from spectral
graph theory can be used to understand motion in high-dimensional datasets such
as those found in medical imaging.

During my Physics PhD at Imperial College London, in the Centre for Complexity Science
my research focused on using ideas from physics, particularly from the
causal set approach to quantum gravity, to understand the structure complex networks.
This involved developing tools to describe network structure in terms of
Lorentzian geometry, which is the geometry of the spacetime of our universe.
I also have an interest in using non-Euclidean geometries in machine learning,
such as using Hyperbolic space, or Minkowski spacetime to embed high-dimensional
data, or network/graph data.
